# Reading the Literature

When researching an idea for a scientific research project, it is necessary to comb through the literature to learn more about the subject. From this step, you will come across tools, data and articles which may prove to be extremely important to your future project. 

The articles that you address for research projects are likely to come from publishers who have completed some type of study that is (in some way) tangent to your own project area. To become a published article for research projects, a written work would have been peer-reviewed to ensure that it contains plausible (reliable) data, use of tools, scientific thinking and that its assessments are logically crafted. Once the written work is able to pass this level of scrutiny, it may be considered to make-up what is known to be the *literature*.

Please note, blogs, postings and similar writings do not make-up this corpus of academic literature as they are **not** necessarily reviewed by experts in the field who check for integrity, and for faults in procedure, method and conduct before they are pushed to social-media sites.

Reading articles is considered to be *active reading* where all effort is to resemble a type of study. To learn about strategies for reading research articles, please visit the below articles.

* [How to Read a Paper](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf) by S. Keshav
* [How to Read a Computer Science Research Paper](https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~litman/courses/cs2710/papers/howtoreadacspaper.pdf) by A. Stent.

A silly website to show you how how topics are paired with actual research articles, please visit the below website.

Note: While the generator has been designed to amuse, one notices how actual keywords can be extracted from an idea to be used to find articles on the topic, whatever it may be!

## Part 1: The Literature and your Area of Interest

During the initial part of this class, you were to ask to spend time to discover area(s) of interest for potential research projects. It is now time to examine more closely the areas surrounding your idea so that you may learn more about how better to contribute to your area of research. For example, you will spend time looking through resources; academic articles, tools, datasets, and other parts, to determine how to design a project that aligns with your thinking and interests.

In this assignment, you are invited to locate and explore various resources (i.e., literature, data, tools, and etc) in your area. You are to respond to several leading questions about these resources that you find in your search (see the File `writing/reflection.md`).

You are also asked to update your list of keywords to help you find resources that affiliate with your research interests. 

### Looking for Resources

To find resources, you could begin by applying your keywords at online search engines such as Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/) to find articles, data and tools and other resources that may be helpful.

### Keywords

Please remember that as you work, you are to go back to your list of keywords to update them as necessary. This means that you might want to remove keywords for subjects that you no-longer care about. Conversely, you may wish to add new ones to bring you closer to resources that align with your thinking. 

* Please add an updated list of keywords to your website.

### Writing Task
You are to find two new articles, a tool or a dataset which could be . 
In the File `writing/reflections.md`, you will be invited to answer the following questions.

## Part 2: Lightning Talk and Slides

For Thursday’s lab and part of Tuesday's class, prepare a three (3) minute “lightning talk”, together with several accompanying slides (written in a software of your choice), in which you introduce an article. For your talk, please introduce your article while addressing the below questions. Remember you will have only three or four minutes in your talk and so you will have to be brief!

* What is the article?
* what is the general topic of the article?
* What is the method?
* what is the deliverable
* How can this article be helpful to your project?


## Summary of deliverables
* Complete your Markdown report (`writing/reflection.md`) for the class assignment grade.
* Prepare and give a three (3) minute lightning talk for Thursday’s class for a checkmark participation point.
* Add an updated list of keywords to your online research notebook.

## Project Assessment

The grade that a student receives on this assignment will have the following components.

- **GitHub Actions CI Build Status [up to 20%]:**: For the repository associated with this assignment students will receive a checkmark grade if their last before-the-deadline build passes. This is only checking some baseline writing and commit requirements as well as correct running of the program. An additional reduction will given if the commit log shows a cluster of commits at the end clearly used just to pass this requirement. An addition reduction will also be given if there is no commit during lab work times. All other requirements are evaluated manually.

- **Mastery of Technical Writing [up to 50%]:**: Students will also receive a checkmark grade when the responses to the writing questions presented in the `reflection.md` reveal a proficiency of both writing skills and technical knowledge. To receive a checkmark grade, the submitted writing should have correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation in addition to following the rules of Markdown and providing conceptually and technically accurate answers.

- **Presentation [up to 30%]:**
Students will receive a checkmark grade for presentations. Student must be present to receive credit for group's presentation.

## GatorGrade

You can check the baseline writing and commit requirements for this lab assignment by running department's assignment checking `gatorgrade` tool. To use `gatorgrade`, you first need to make sure you have Python3 installed (type `python --version` to check). If you do not have Python installed, please see:

- [Setting Up Python on Windows](https://realpython.com/lessons/python-windows-setup/)
- [Python 3 Installation and Setup Guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)
- [How to Install Python 3 and Set Up a Local Programming Environment on Windows 10](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-python-3-and-set-up-a-local-programming-environment-on-windows-10)

Then, if you have not done so already, you need to install `gatorgrade`:

- First, [install `pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/)
- Then, install `gatorgrade` with `pipx install gatorgrade`

Finally, you can run `gatorgrade`:

`gatorgrade --config config/gatorgrade.yml`

  + [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
* Do not forget to use the above git commands to push your work to the cloud for the instructor to grade your assignment. You can go to your GitHub repository using your browser to verify that your files have been submitted. Please see the TL’s or the instructor if you have any questions about assignment submission.

Students who have questions about this project outside of the lab time are invited
to ask them in the course's Discord channel or during instructor's or TL's office hours.
